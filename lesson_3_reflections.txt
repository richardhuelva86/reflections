When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd want to use it if I need to share with more people the content of the repository (collaborative work)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may keep master not updated until you merged an experimental branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are useful when you don't have permissions to modify a repository on github or you don't want to modify it directly, so you prefer to have a copy of entire repository.
Instead of that, clone makes a copy of a repository on your local machine, and finally branches work over a repository, allowing to create experimental points from a state.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If remote server is down, you can still work with the updated version of remote state


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I'd collaborate through a public directory without version control... or a bad version control based on copies of folders, but it's a mess
